Of course. Here is a summary and description formatted perfectly for a GitHub README.md file.

You should create a file named README.md in the root of your project folder and paste the text below into it. GitHub will automatically display this on your repository's main page.

C++ Command-Line To-Do List Manager üìù
This is a simple yet robust command-line To-Do List application built in C++. It utilizes a custom-implemented singly linked list to manage tasks, demonstrating core concepts of data structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The application allows users to add tasks with a priority, view them in a sorted list, and mark them as complete.

‚ú® Key Features
Add Tasks: Add new tasks with a text description and a numerical priority.

Prioritized View: Tasks are automatically sorted and displayed in order of priority (lower numbers are higher priority).

Complete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list by selecting their number.

Memory Safe: Implemented with a focus on proper dynamic memory management to prevent memory leaks.
